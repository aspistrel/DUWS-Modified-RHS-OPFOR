//  HOW TO MANUALLY CREATE THE MISSION:   
//  1)YOU MUST PLACE THE HQ LOCATION
//  2)DEFINE THE CAPTURABLE ZONES
//  -- YOU CAN ALSO JUST PUT A HQ SOMEWHERE AND LET THE ZONES BEING RANDOMLY GENERATED
//  -- YOU MUST PLACE MANUALLY THE HQ IF YOU ARE ALREADY PLACING THE ZONES BY HAND 
//  3) DONT FORGET TO DEFINE THE VARIABLES BELOW. If you are ONLY placing the HQ by hand, you just need to put "hq_manually_placed" to "true" instead of "false". If you are also placing the zones by hand, make "zones_manually_placed" to "true".
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//  1) In the gamelogic, for the HQ( !! MAKE ONLY ONE HQ !!): _null=[getpos this] execVM "initHQ\BluHQinit.sqf" 
// 
//  2) In the init of gamelogic, to create a capturable enemy zone: _null = ["zone name",pts awarded upon capture, zone radius,getpos this,false/true,false/true] execvm "createzone.sqf";
//  "zone name": name of the zone
//  pts awarded upon capture: points you earn when you capture the zone. Also the amount of points of army power you take and receive from the enemy after capture
//  zone radius: how large the zone is
//  getpos this: It's the position of the zone. The gamelogic actually. You don't have to modify this.
//  false/true: if the zone is fortified or not. If the zone is fortified, there will be a bit more enemies and they will be maning static defences if there are any
//  false/true: if the zone is selecting randomly a prefab base. Prefab is selected according to the zone radius. The bigger the zone, the bigger the prefab asset will be chosen.

//  EXAMPLE, in the init of a gamelogic you have placed on the map:_null=["OP Xander",20,200,getpos this,true,false] execvm "initZones\createzone.sqf"

It is basically a free-roam type of camera system that will stay active for only 60 seconds per use and will allow your camera to quickly view any location on the map by first hitting your Spacebar key and then clicking anywhere on your map screen.<br/><br/>Unlocking this feature costs a certain amount of CP plus additional CP each time you use it/call it from your 0-8 menu. After each use there is a 5 minute wait period before you're allowed to use it again.<br/><br/>*KNOWN ISSUES* - if you're viewing the map screen when the timer runs out you will be stuck on the map screen with no way out. If this happens you must wait 5 minutes for the camera system to reappear on the 0-8 menu and then call it again to remove yourself from the map screen. This is a game bug and cannot be fixed by the mission maker.<br/><br/>Another issue is that the ""H"" for help key will not unbind itself from bringing up the camera's help menu even after the camera has been removed. This can interfere with other scripts or addons that use the ""H"" key. This is a game bug and cannot be fixed by the mission maker since the camera system used here is hard coded and built into Arma3."]];
