_________________________________________________________________________________________________________


A BIG thank you to Kibot for making and releasing his original version. This is my favorite mission to play in Arma 3 with a small group of friends or alone, and without his hard work and skills I probably wouldn't be playing Arma 3 at all yet.

what modifications I've done so far with the first version:


- added Armory to FOB's

- added Rest/save to HQ

- added HALO to HQ & FOB's (action menu)

- added Request Units dialogue to FOB's (limited units available only)

- added HEAL to HQ & FOB's (action menu)

- added Repair/Re-arm Vehicles to FOB's (action menu)

- added Teleport/Fast Travel now works with group

- added more options for higher CP mission start (100,200,300,400,600 added)

- added Disable Fatigue option in Parameters screen in mission lobby

- added Time of Day start option in Parameters screen in mission lobby

- added some nite lighting to HQ & FOB's (applied when fortifying)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of Jan 23rd, 2014:
- added option to start with higher AP (so enemy will use attack choppers)
- added MLRS to list of vehicles you can request (cost is 100 CP)
- added Titan launchers and their magazines (AA & AT) to the Nato Support Box (supply drop) so AI in your group   can rearm themselves (f#-6).
- adjusted spawn location when requesting units so they'll spawn a bit farther away from the HQ/FOB building     and not get stuck inside.
- fixed the ComboScrollbar errors
- fixed a couple different .rpt errors
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of Jan 27th, 2014:
- adjusted clean-up script to remove wrecked vehicles and dead bodies every 20 minutes

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of Jan 28th, 2014:
- fixed support drop (ammo box) from landing too far away (should now land within 30m of where you are     standing when initializing the request)
- fixed an .rpt error related to HALO script
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of Jan 29th, 2014:
- fixed settings menu dialogue error in action menu (TAWS terrain view distance)
- addended the word "Modified" to mission name and in arma3 menu's to avoid confusion and so you can have both   versions installed (original and modified) to play without conflict.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of Jan 30th, 2014:
- added Scorcher artillary vehicle (100cp) by request (buy at HQ only, not FOB's)
- changed frequency of how often dead vehicles & dead bodies are removed to aid fps performance (every 10   minutes for vehicles/every 15 minutes for bodies)
- requested vehciles spawn slightly further away (+10)from HQ/FOB to avoid possible collision/explosions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of Feb 05th, 2014:
- fixed a couple of typos in the mission
- new mission briefing pic to more closely match Kibot's original
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of Feb 12th, 2014:
- fixed a bug that caused certain items in your inventory to be duplicated when respawning with REVIVE enabled.
Now, if you play with revive enabled you do not need to use the "load on" button in the armory.
Now, if you play with revive disabled you DO have to use the "load on" button in armory (to respawn with saved loadout). See *note below.

- updated to latest VAS (armory) script (2.4)

- changed HALO ---> All players must now unlock HALO from their request menu to use it (cost 7cp).

- changed Armory ---> All players must now unlock Armory to see it at HQ & FOB action menu's and Supply     Drops (cost 3cp). All players must call in their own supply drops to see Armory in the Nato Box.

- fixed FOB Repair/Rearm Vehicles ---> All players must now unlock Vehicle Refit to see "Repair/Rearm" at FOB   action menu and to use it at HQ with 0-8 menu.

- Time of day as set in the Params menu now syncs properly with JIP players.

*NOTE* - when playing with revive enabled, IF YOU DIE during a HALO attempt you will still be wearing your parachute when you respawn and so it will be necessary to reload your saved kit at an armory.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of Feb 19th, 2014:

- fixed: teleport/fast travel position has been changed so you & group will not teleport under building anymore...you & group will now teleport just outside front door.

- added small fuel truck(10cp) to request menu vehicles. 

- added slammer tank section squads(55cp) & AA tank platoon squads(70cp)

- added new support usage costs: Halo (7cp to unlock + 3cp per use), Fast Travel/Teleport (2cp per use), Heal (2cp per use), Vehicle Refit at FOB (2cp per use)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of Feb 26th, 2014:

- fixed: the "No Fast Travel for Chopper Taxi" Option is now functioning as it should and is set as default.

- fixed: Personal Flir "enable/disable" addaction now works after respawning (under certain conditions you may notice 2 instances of enable appearing in action menu but it will still function properly).

- fixed: When Field Commander Ability unlocks, the Squad Manager Action Menu Item no longer disappears if player respawns.

- tweaked: Default AI skills (should be more difficult to survive now)

- Parameters: Death Penalty defaults at 1cp now, so you lose 1cp each time a human player gets killed.

- New Startup Option for AP Added (225ap is now default...all the other ap options are still there if you wish to choose them at startup).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of Feb 28th, 2014:

- tweaked default AI skills again (a little less harsh than previous update, best suited for having your OPTIONS/GAME/DIFFICULTY settings at 0.3)

- tweaked default starting AP down to 200 (alot less attack choppers, sometimes none at all...depends)

- capped starting AP options at 250 for those who want attack choppers gauranteed to come.

- updated to newest HALO script (ATM Airdrop v6 by Pokertour...thank you!)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of March 06th, 2014:

- VEHICLE REFIT: now works at FOB's with the 0-8 menu just as it does at HQ! Thank you Kibot for helping me with that code!! No more having to drive up so close to FOBs anymore...works within 50m, even in choppers!...therefore the "repair" action menu item has been removed since it is not needed.

- NEW Parameter Option (in LAN/Internet mission lobby screen): Enable/Disable Attack Choppers; this is perfect for those who want to start mission with high AP (170-200) but do not want enemy choppers included...also saves fps performance over time! (N/A in Scenario mode).

- Workshop Version ONLY: old way of saving has been re-enabled so you should now be able to use RESUME in SP Scenario using the Steam Workshop version. 

- bug fixed: REVIVE ISSUE - "Always on" Action items missing after respawning with REVIVE ON...this issue is now fixed and you will retain all your action items when playing with revive ON, however a side effect of this fix is that the "revive" action item will pop-up in your action menu whenever you are within close range of (3m) and pointing to someone you've already revived. I can't get rid of it, sorry...but not a bad trade-off really.

- more tweaks to default Opfor skill (best results with your main arma3 menu difficulty slider set to 0.3-0.5 for enemy and 1.0 for friendly)

- new default AP set to 170 (war starts slowly at first but gets intense by 3rd or 4th zone)...BEWARE:use with caution, will cause low fps after awhile...but most high end pc's should maintain 20-35fps. If you dont have a very strong pc then use low AP for start, or consider using the new parameter option to disable attack choppers.

- warcom script adjustments: seems that armored enemy vehicles will actually shoot now :-)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of March 10th, 2014:

- Helicopter Taxi & Boat Taxi Fixed: big improvement in chopper/boat behavior when enemy is detected, no more turning away from LZ or endless hovering in the air. Taxi is now operating much more solid, and can be used as reliable transportation, finally!

- HALO on RESUME/LOAD Fixed: When playing a "resumed" or "loaded" session Halo'ing will now give you back your backpack (assuming if you had one in your kit when jumping). Yay!

- HALO chemlights - if you use a chemlight or strobe during your HALO jump you now need to manually remove it after you land, or it will stay lit! (you can remove the light in your action menu). 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of March 23rd, 2014:

- FOB Creation & Fortification now works for all connected players.

- Artillary/JDAM/Mortar/CBU type supports can now be called by all connected players (players must unlock them first of course).

- Zone Captured & Lost Notifications are now broadcast to all connected players, instead of just the host.

- Blufor team (Players & AI) now earns 0.5cp for each enemy killed on the battlefield.

- HQ Officer can no longer be killed by human players (open servers no longer need to fear a rogue player logging in to kill the officer and ending mission prematurely).

- All players are now group leaders (due to MP issues with AI managment & respawns the ability to join other players groups has been removed, as it should be)

- All players now have markers shown on map, including their vehicle info! (controlled via params menu in mission lobby-enabled by default) script by Aeroson (Thank you!).

- HALO Cost Increased: 10cp to unlock + 5cp per use (to avoid spamming it, and to encourage use of the cost saving and more reaslistic Helo Taxi since it is very reliable now)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of March 24th, 2014:

- JOIN PLAYER'S GROUP: in Mission lobby, scroll to bottom of role selections to find an open joinable group for up to 5 players. This is included for small player groups who all wish to play in the same group together. It Works best in private servers where players have planned to work in cooperation together without the use of AI.

- More Officer Protection added: player "thrown" or "put" explosives are not allowed within 50m of the HQ building.

- New Request Units Menu addition: Added A-164 Wipeout Airplane (75cp) - *note* spawn this at your own risk for obvious reasons you need to make sure the HQ is located on a flat surface inside an airport so that you'll have access to a runway for taking off...otherwise don't bother buying it!!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of April 3rd, 2014:

- FOB REQUESTS IN GREEN ZONES ONLY: you must now be located within 250m of a friendly green zone's CENTER to request/build an FOB. You can no longer build one anywhere on the map, nor in enemy territory.

- Added SlammerUP M2A4 Tank (55cp), Stomper UGV (both armed (20cp) and unarmed versions (10cp). *Note* to control the UGV's you'll need to grab yourself a "UAV Terminal" from the Armory/Misc/Items

- Chopper Taxi: the sliding doors and smokeshells have now returned!

- New Startup Dialog Options: added more choices for maximum distance from HQ (2km,3km,4km) when creating enemy zones. This allows for improved compatibility with some smaller 3rd party maps.

- "officer killed" alert messages are now broadcast to all connected players, instead of just the host.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of April 09th, 2014:

- 6 NEW Support Unlocks for HIGH COMMAND Fans!!: **DISCLAIMER** Arma3 High Command and it's AI can be very unreliable, especially in MP environments. Please keep this in mind when using the HC Unlocks and do NOT blame me! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK, hehe.
  
After Unlocking these in the Supports list, you can call them in your 0-8 menu:

High Command CAS Plane(25cp to unlock + 15cp per use)
High Command Attack Chopper(25cp to unlock + 15cp per use)
High Command Air Transport (10cp to unlock + 3cp per use)
High Command Ground Transport HEMTT (8cp to unlock + 2cp per use)
High Command Repair Team (8cp to unlock + 4cp per use)
High Command Refuel Team (8cp to unlock + 2cp per use)
*If you aren't familiar with using High Command this is the time to learn how because it's a blast in this mission, when/if the AI does what you want! :-)
**These 6 new items can only be "unlocked" at HQ, and then used anywhere/anytime on the map you wish. You cannot unlock them at FOB's.
***WARNING: HC vehicles can really hurt frames so do not spam this feature. Use sparingly when really needed (no more than 1 or 2 at one time).


- JIP spawning issues fixed (keeping fingers crossed!): Should be no more swimming or spawning in wrong location when you join mission in progress.

- HALO: Can no longer Halo within 1km of a red zone's center. Your clickspot on map must be a MINIMUM of 1km away from the center of any red zones.  Also, height increased to 2,500.

- NO MORE SUPPORT UNLOCKS AT FOB's (due to the new RE-LOCK feature mentioned below).

- THERE ARE NOW SQUAD UNLOCKS AT FOB's (limited: only 3 to choose from including fireteam, AT & AA and they cost 50% more than buying them at HQ)

- NEW SUPPORT UNLOCKS FEATURE: You can now RE-LOCK 17 of the 21 supports from the support list after you've unlocked/purchased them at HQ(except for armory, pFlir, halo and specialist training)! Upon re-locking an item (returning your virtual purchase) you will also get 1/2 (half) your CP (money) back (you only get half to avoid exploitation of this feature).

- NEW SUPPORT UNLOCK ITEM: *for emergency use only* - the last item on the list will add the "request fob" support item back to your 0-8 menu (to be used incase you unlock too many supports and lose the fob request item out of your 0-8 menu). 

- CBU20 Cluster Support: slightly nerfed/less effective with smaller footprint, takes slightly less time to arrive and is cheaper to unlock (was too overpowered before).

- Fast Travel/Teleport: improved it's vitualization increasing the time it takes to fast travel (instead of instantaneous).

- Removed "Armory" from NATO "Supply Drops". Now that the mission has expanded it's become too overpowered for game balance. Rocket launchers and ammo will remain, and you can also still use it to rearm your AI and HC squads.

- Listbox Auto-Scroll Issue fixed in the Request Units Menu (no more wacky scroll behavior when unlocking supports).

- Fixed a bug remaining from orginal duws: public variable was not properly keeping track of which side owns which zones at any given time, and this broke anything that depends upon that info (i.e.still being able to create fob's in recaptured red zones, warcom spawning enemy in empty green zones. FIXED). 

- Some CP cost adjustments for purchasing certain individual vehicles & squads (armored, air & artillary).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of April 11th, 2014:

- Added a mapclick "distance" hint helper in map screen during halo's. If you don not click far enough away from a red zone's center the hint will appear telling how far away your previous click was and asks you to try clicking again further away.
- Increased height of auto-open parachute by 50m during Halo's due to the higher starting altitude and faster descent speed. This will prevent injury for those who don't open chute on their own.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of April 15th, 2014:

- Added New Side-Mission(#1 slot in mission list): with capturable AAF Strider "Mobile Teleport Vehicle (MTV)" which you get to keep & use as a new teleporter if you successfully complete the mission! *Note - you can teleport/fast travel to the vehcile no matter where it is, and it also provides you access to the FOB/HQ Teleport screen. It will not respawn so if destroyed you'll have to play & complete the mission again.

- Added New High Command Support Unlock for 0-8 menu: "Bobcat" armored vehicle capable of performing repairs/rearm/refuel (25cp to unlock + 8cp per call).

- Added Click Distance Hint: for use with the new halo restriction on map screen, makes it alot easier to find an allowed halo ckickspot on the map which conforms to the new 1km rule.

- Fixed Halo Restriction: Now works properly for connected clients. Clients can no longer halo by clicking directly on or too near a red zone.

- Resume fix for host: when "resuming" a saved mission your 0-8 menu unlocks do not get restored until you respawn once. FIXED, you no longer need to respawn after a "Resume" (only works for host since savegame in arma3 cannot save client info).

- Minor Bug Fixes.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of April 18th, 2014:

- Player can no longer move about or be injured during teleporting process.
- Addended an official mission version number to the Mission Selection Screen & Briefing so players can more easily know if they're up-to-date; New Official Version as of today is v.1.0 (removed using any version number in file name).
- More minor bug fixes: related to new side mission where the MTV vehicle's action menu item may not show up for certain connected clients.
- More minor bug fixes: related to new side mission's task succeeded/failed HINT message not showing up for connected clients.
- More minor bug fixes: related to new side mission where the MTV vehicle's map marker may not show up for certain connected clients.
- More minor bug fixes: msic. JIP issues.
- Fixed: some minor rpt errors.
*IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT JIP - if you JIP and the host has "revive" enabled but you have no revive option after death
and you keep respawning without your saved weapon kit, the best work-around is to simply close down and reboot arma3 and then rejoin the server again.
JIP DOES work when you do it this way.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of April 24th, 2014: version 1.1

- New DUWS AI Limiter---> If this option is ENABLED: (plays with less enemy and improved fps/lag, much like a Duws Lite!)
1.Automatically limits the amount of AI (friendly & enemy) that the warcom scripts will spawn into the mission as time passes. The warcom scripts may decide not to spawn any new AI patrols, wave attacks or QRF reinforcements (friendly or enemy) IF it thinks the total amount of living units on the map has risen too high (100-140), and will cache any previous warcom request in waiting. When the total unit numbers drop low enough the warcom cached requests will continue to spawn AI as normal.
2.It will stop you from fortifying FOB's anytime the total number of units in the mission rise to 100+. You can still build the FOB, however, fortifying will have to wait until unit numbers fall back below 100 (use the new AI Info HINT in the Squad Manager screen anytime you like). 
3.It will also effect the amount of enemy groups initially spawned into red zones at mission start (approx. 25% fewer enemy at mission start and continued lower amounts as mission continues).
4.The START screen will limit the number of zones you can create to a maximum of 6.
5.The START screen will limit the size of the zones to a maximum of 1,000.
This is not meant to INCREASE fps, but only to help in keeping the fps from spiking downward too low & for too long, therefore allowing longer periods of play at more reasonable fps levels.
**This feature is a new Parameter option that can be toggled on/off in mission's MP lobby screen. It is always "OFF" by default. If you leave it OFF, DUWS plays as normal without any restrictions. Turn it ON and it plays like a Duws Lite with alot less enemy but much smoother play and less or no lag at all. It's your choice!

- New Warcom Spawn HINTS: Hint displays automatically in upper right hand corner of hud whenever the warcom scripts spawn new AI into the mission. Only works when the DUWS AI Limiter is ON in Params menu, and is there as a reminder that the limiter is ON.

- New AI Info HINT: Displays the amount of AI currently alive in the mission. You can use this when the DUWS Limiter is on or off to see how many AI get spawned over time and can also be used to help you to know when it's ok to fortify an FOB or recruit new AI without tanking your fps. This hint is displayed each time you enter the "Squad Manager" screen (which can be accessed anywhere/anytime in action menu once you've accrued 30 persistant experience points).

- More bug fixing: for the green MTV-1 vehicle marker not always showing up after completing side-mission #1. If it remains problematic the script may be changed.

- Warcom script adjustments, to try and reduce the frequency & duration of downward fps spikes under certain conditions.

**A word about AI & performance issues** - in Arma you should always think twice before requesting/spawning more friendly AI into the mission or choosing how many and the size of zones to start with, always use the bare minimum whenever possible, especially vehicles & aircraft which have the worst fps effects. If you're going to request new vehciles do only 1 at a time. Hosting a MP game server also has a large negative effect on your fps. While the mission lets us make our own decisions and play as we like. we must still use common sense here. You shouldn't wonder why you're getting only 20 fps when you have 8+ zones, a bunch of AI vehicles active on the map and 3 more empties waiting back at base :-) Always use caution and get to know what your machine and personal game settings will allow you to get away with in arma.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of April 25th, 2014: re-Release of version 1.1 due to due to typo error which caused some enemy not to spawn when zones are created at mission start.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of May 3rd, 2014: version 1.2

- 2 NEW SIDE MISSIONS:
1. DEFUSE THE GORGON (#2 on side missions list) - Earn a new Gorgon vehicle AND 200 spendable CP or risk losing ALL OF YOUR CP! You must find the defuse code among the enemy units in the AO (look for action menu item "check his papers"), then locate the boobie-trapped Gorgon to enter the code on its keypad (action menu) and stop it from blowing up within 30 minutes.
2. DO or DIE (#3 on side missions list) - You Must Save Your Commanding Officer. You must go to the AO marked on your map and locate the briefcase which contains the secret defuse code, then make it back to HQ within 30 minutes
   so you can disarm the bomb before the officer blows up! The briefcase can be anywhere on the ground within the AO! If you are successful you will earn 250 spendable CP, if you are not successful it's Mission Over and you lose at DUWS!

- further tweaks to the new Duws AI Limiter to increase it's stability and reliability; seems to be keeping the mission quite smooth now! Try enabling this AI Limiter, enable Attack Aircraft and turn the AP up to the 200 max setting on the Startup screen and enjoy the mahem at 50+fps for hours!
- increased wait time to 5 minutes in between calls for artillary,jdams,mortar,CBU20
- added a new CP hint to the Squad Manager so you can check your cp whenever/wherever you like.
- removed HQ Officer animation so he stands still now (also because BIS broke the anims which cause rpt sound errors to be spammed, and we dont want that!)
- more price adjustments for some support unlocks
- updated body/vehicle cleanup script
- more misc. rpt error fixes

*** TO INSTALL ***:
1. Delete any previous pbo files of DUWS MODIFIED version that may be in either your missions or MPmissions folder.
2. Place the new pbo file into the Arma3\MPmissions folder.
3. That's it, Go start an in-game LAN/INTERNET server and Play it!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of May 5th, 2014: version 1.3

- adjusted Helo Taxi script so that any group members in other vehicles (other than the taxi) will not exit those vehicles if/when the helo taxi lands. Everyone inside the taxi will still automatically get out as usual.
- adjusted Warcom Zone Creation script so that enemy armor which gets spawned at mission start will not spawn too close to prefabs and potentially flip over or explode anymore.
- disabled the auto-save (too annoying and not necessary since you can save whenever you like with 0-8-1 in pbo version or esc/save in steam workshop version).
- added the mtv1 variable to mission init to get rid of a minor rpt error being thrown by the Teleport menu.
- cleaned up some left over scripts

- *** Quick note about enemy armor and how it spawns:
At mission start, enemy armor will only spawn at zones that are GREATER THAN(>) 500m radius (this has nothing to do with armor that spawns later in the mission, however). 
The default MINIMUM size for zones at mission start is 250m (on the startup screen), therefore, if only 3 zones are created by default and 2 of those zones are 500m or less in size,
that means that initally, armor will only spawn at 1 of the zones at mission start. SO... if you want more armor at mission start then choose the next minimum size up for zones (which is 500m in the startup screen).
By setting the MINIMUM size for zones at 500m you will likely see most zones greater than 500m in size and so you will likely see armor spawned at almost all zones.
Just remember that by upping the minimum zone size and causing more armor to spawn then you are also going to take an fps hit to some extent (youll probably see 10fps difference...but that's Arma).
	  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of September 16th, 2014: version 1.4

- reduced cost of calling for HC air supports in the 0-8 menu for both the attack chopper & plane (was previously set at 12cp, now it's only costs 5cp, to compensate for the unreliable AI)
- reduced radius of mission area for the "Do or Die" mission so the briefcase will be a little easier to find.
- added 2 new vehicle unlocks in the request menu - small transport truck 1 (seats 6 - cost 4cp) & small transport truck 2 (seats 9 - cost 6cp)
- added 3 UAV's to the request vehicles menu (GhostHawk w/missiles & GhostHawk w/bombs at HQ, Darter at HQ & FOB's)
- increased distance of enemy approach warning messages so you'll have a LITTLE more time to react and take appropriate defensive action (was 300m, is now 500m).
- added new sound effect - a short but loud warning siren will sound whenever an enemy is within 500m of either the HQ or an FOB (this ensures you'll know if your HQ officer needs protection,just incase you missed the usual chat text warnings which are easy to miss; sound file made by DarkXess)
- added Arma3's built-in "Virtual Arsenal" so it can be used as an alternative Armory (VAS still remains so players can use whichever armory they prefer, there is now an armory1 and armory2) .

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of September 22nd, 2014: version 1.5

- added: new AI revive options in the parameters screen...AI in your group can now revive you! (revive options are now revive off;revive on (humans only);revive on (humans +AI)...see notes in map screen).
- added: random roadside IED's (enabled/disbaled in Parameters screen. See notes in map screen for more info)
- fixed: was finally able (after many months) to reproduce certain conditions that was causing the officer to run away from the HQ for some players, this should now be fixed and he should NOT run away anymore.
*IMPORTANT NOTE* - SP "Scenario" mode no longer supported or recommended (if you run the mission in this mode you will have issues, please do not report them). If you want to play alone please use MP LAN mode and do not forget to access the Parameters Screen in mission's MP lobby.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of Oct 3rd, 2014: version 1.6

- added: new "Varied & Dynamic" weather setting option with variably changing conditions as you play (moving clouds,fronts,wind,rain,fog,lightning,raindbows,sun). Note - See in-game Map notes for more info.
- added: new squad manager option to delete AI units in your group (disband/delete units on team yellow) - See in-game duws manual section in map notes.
- added: new enable/disable option for the enemy warning siren (available in the Parameters Menu on the mission's unit selction screen: enabled by default)
- improved: enemy warnings (both the text and warning siren) are now MP compatible so all players get aural and text warnings when FOB's & HQ are being attacked.
- fixed: logic bug that caused the support requests to not re-lock and refund (you can now re-lock supports by re-clicking its unLock button and receive a 50% refund...fun way to get back some spendable cp when you're all out!).
- changed: decreased cost of the pFLIR support unlock (was 20cp, is now only 12cp).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New As of October 16th, 2014: version 1.7


- new: added new feature to FOB/Teleport Manager - you can now choose to either fast travel "alone" or with your "group".

- fixed: when fatigue is disabled in parameters menu it now effects the single AI units you recruit into your group (Regular units, SpecOps and Airborn Troops), and not just humans. This allows the AI to keep pace with you better and not fall behind so much!
- new: added Army Power(AP) info to the Squad Manager Hint (now you can easily see what each teams AP is anytime you wish).
- updated: VAS script (Armory#1) updated to latest version 2.6 so you now get 15 kit slots instead of 10.

- changed: cost to unlock airborn troops decreased to 15cp
- changed: cost to use/call airborn troops decreased to 24cp (you still get 8 troops)
- changed: increased wait time in between support calls for HC CAS & Attack Chopper.
- fixed: opfor was not losing AP after blufor would capture a zone. Now the more zones you cap the weaker opfor becomes over time.
- added: main base map marker now indicates if the HQ officer has been killed (marker turns orange and will be labeled "officer killed" when playing with the new losing condition parameter)
- fixed: AI revive bug which caused you to sometimes lose command of your group. You should no longer lose command when AI revive is used. A HUGE thanks and a spot in our mission scripting credits goes out to "MDCCLXXVI" for fixing this annoying issue!.
- changed: volume reduced for the enemy warning siren sound (you're welcome, lol).
- All new features are MP compatible and also work for JIP. If you encounter JIP issues have a good read in the common questions forum at our steam workshop page because it will cure all your JIP issues.

*Selectable Mission Win/Lose Conditions: Cap All Zones/Officer Killed -OR- Cap All Zones/Officer & Players Killed.
For players who wish they had ONE LAST CHANCE to continue playing and win the mission after the HQ Officer is killed.
 If you select this new mode in the mission lobby's Parameters menu here is how it works:
1. If officer dies you still get one more chance to try and win (mission does not end yet).
2. You still have to finish capping all the zones to "win".
3. If you fall injured you still have ability to use Revive(if it was enabled at mission start params menu).
4. If officer gets killed you lose all services and menus at the HQ. Fob services/menus stay intact, and you also get to retain all your previous unlocks that youve earned and requested earlier.
5. If officer gets killed then you lose the ability to respawn, so if YOU die after he gets killed (and you don't get revived) the mission is over for you and you will be given a free-roam spectator's camera to watch your friends continue to play and try to win. Mission will end  when either your team caps all the zones (win) or all human players are dead (lose), AFTER the officer has been killed.

New As of November 8th, 2014: version 1.75

- New: official FFV (fire from vehicles) is now active for the following vehicles in Duws Modified:
1. CH67 Chopper
2. Mi290 Chopper
3. MH-9 Chopper
4. UH80 GhostHawk Chopper
5. M-900 Civilian Mini Copter
5. Off-road truck
6. HEMTT Transport
- New: official BIS DLC added:
1. additional Helo Taxi support options avialable to unlock in the Requests menu: Mi290 Taru Bench Taxi, CH-67 Taxi w/animated door/ramp sequence, MH-9 Taxi(not DLC).
2. new sling loading CH-67 transport chopper now available for purchase via the requests menu.
3. new sling loading Mi-290 chopper now available for purchase via the requests menu at HQ & FOBs.
4. new M-900 Civilian Mini Copter now available for purchase via the requests menu at HQ & FOBs.

- New: Recon Camera System available as a new Support Unlock in your Requests menu. Basically a 60 second free-roam camera that lets you view any location on the map that you wish with a 5 minute wait period in between uses. 10cp to unlock/5cp per use/175AP required for camera to function. See in-game manual for details.
- Improved: Restructring & partial rewrite of all Warcom scripts (including the AI Limiter) for better balance of armor, air assets and troops as AP & Time increases. You'll now see enemy attack aircraft at lower AP and sooner than before (150ap+ needed for attack aircraft to spawn for either side), but no more armor and aircraft cluster frucking after 2+ hours since there is now a cap on how many armor,aircraft and troops will autospawn into the mission. The AI limiter cap has been increased a little so fortifying FOBs should be easier now if the AI Limiter is enabled.
- Improved: Tweaked "Assassinate Officer" side-mission so it's more challenging and notifications work with MP.
- Improved: Tweaked "Sabotage" side-mission so it's a bit more challenging and notifications work with MP.
- Improved: Tweaked the Gorgon & Do-or-Die missions so the time-bombs can be defused by any player (previously only worked for the host).
- Fixed: Rescue side-mission's trigger was accidentally broken...now the troops you rescue will join your group as they should.
- Changed: "Do or Die" side-mission's AO size has now been moderately increased for a better challenge, although the area is still not as large as when it was originally introduced into Duws.
- Fixed: "Do or Die" side-mission now fixed/adjusted so it still functions & ends correctly when played with the new mission-end parameter if officer gets killed during that side-mission.
- Fixed: logic bug in support unlocking/re-locking which caused 0-8 menu stacking when re-locking certain items before they returned to the 0-8 menu after use. After using a support you must now wait until that support is returned back to the 0-8 menu before you can re-lock it and receive a refund.
- Fixed: group halo bug cuasing various issues when using it with human players joined in the same group together (the group at bottom of unit selection screen). Works perfect now.
- New: added action "Detonate Taxi" which appears in yor action menu after you call one of the chopper taxi's. Chopper will self destruct on a 5 second hint timer with its use and taxi service will return to 0-8 menu if you need to re-call it. Usage is intended for times when taxi chopper gets unexpetedly "stuck" or "broken" and you need to recall it again.
- Changed: changed name of the "Request Units" menu to "Requests Menu" (makes more sense since you can do and request alot more than just units here, its really the heart of the entire mission).
- Changed: some of the mission start screen 'defaults' have been changed to now offer better spread & balanced play when using default settings.
- Fixed: some rpt errors introduced from recent game patches have been squahed.
- Duws in-game manual updated.

***KNOWN ISSUES*** (see in-game manual which is now being updated regularly for the most recent issues which are mentioned in the individual tabs for each specific feature): 


- **THIS HAS BEEN FIXED FOR THE HOST AS OF APRIL 15th,2014** - RESUMING on self hosted server causes previous SUPPORT UNLOCKS to disappear from the 0-8 menu FIXED;
  But it cannot be fixed for connected clients due to Arma3 game save limitations. *NOTE - you MUST NOT UNLOCK more than 8 items to your 0-8 menu if you want to see them again after you resume a save.

- WHEN ENTERING MISSION I AM SWIMMING -or- AFTER JOINING THE MISSION ALREADY IN PROGRESS (JIP) I CANNOT BE REVIVED AND I RESPAWN WITHOUT MY SAVED WEAPON:
  these are JIP issues and only ocur if you've joined a server after the mission has started. It's always best practice to join the mission when the host is still in the lobby screen
  so that all players start the mission together, however, some players like to "back out" and rejoin for various reasons so...

  JOINING IN PROGRESS DOES WORK ---> the best work-arounds:
  1 - if you're having issues with swimming after joining in progress is to simply esc/respawn once.

  2 - if you're having issues with revive, fatigue won't disable or weapon kits not spawning correctly then close down and reboot arma3, and then rejoin the server again. 
      JIP DOES work when you do it this way. 

- HIGH COMMAND: if you get killed/respawn with HC units that you've transferred into your private group, you will lose control of them and HC may even stop working altogether.
  THIS IS AN ARMA3 MP ISSUE. Arm3 HC is not MP compatible and this can not be fixed. Therefore, I suggest that when using HC that you NOT tranfer them into your private group bar,
  leave them in HC where they belong.

- ENEMY DOESN'T SHOOT/ENGAGE ME: assuming you are properly updated with my newest version of the mission, this is an issue that has ALWAYS turned out to be user error on the players part.
  I know because I've helped many people through it. Usually it's due to poorly set AI skill in the main arma3 menu system and/or unreasonable mission settings. 
  You need to go to your main arma3 game menu/configure/game/difficulty and then set the AI skill slider to NORMAL. Then RESTART the mission and do NOT touch any of the settings
  on the startup screen...just click start. You should see a big difference now. If you don't then your pc cannot handle the large amounts of AI in this mission and you'll need
  a faster CPU in your pc. I've also seen players having the same problem even though their enemy AI skill was set at 1.0 (which may be too high for your cpu). 
  So remember, set main arma difficulty slider to NORMAL and then play mission without changing the settings in the mission startup screen...just leave it "as is" as a test. 
  Every single time I've talked a player through this on voice it's fixed his issue and the enemy is all over him :-)
  
- When using a MAX DISTANCE setting of 2.0km for zones, the side-missions will take a long time to load and sometimes will not load at all. This is because the side missions
  always search for a safe area that is a MINIMUM of 1.5km away from the HQ, and if you use a MAX dist. for zones setting of 2.0km the side mission will search for a safe place
  that is somewhere between 1.5km and 2.0km away from the HQ. So you are only giving it 500m of freedom to find a good site to place the mission. This makes it take longer to load
  and sometimes it may not load at all. Use a higher max dist. for zones the next time you start the mission and this will not be an issue for you. 
  Usually choosing the 2.5km setting (or higher) will end up working just fine with the side missions.

Keep in mind that the 2.0 setting really wasn't meant to be used with large maps like Altis....I put in such a low setting for players to use on very tiny maps
...like some of the ones from arma2 and other 3rd party map packs which might only be 5km in size.

*****YOU SHOULD ALSO CHECK THE NOTES IN YOUR MAP SCREEN FOR FURTHER ISSUES WHICH MAY LISTED INDIVIDUALLY IN THE TABS OF SOME OF THE NEWER FEATURES.*****
